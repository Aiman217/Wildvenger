As a result of disturbance, competition for space and hunting, Banteng are increasingly forced to eke out an existence in closed forest, where there is less  ground-level vegetation.</p>
                   <p>Their diet comprises various grasses and sedges, as well herbs, some bamboo and other fibrous, woody vegetation. They are also known to visit natural mineral licks in search of nutrients, in common with Elephant and Asian Tapir.</p>
